## Basic guidelines

- To have only one model per implementation project. This will save you from unnecessary problems with model compatibility and dependencies in between.

- To have only one extension per application object. This will allow the developer to see and understand all customizations of the object.

- Do not have several developers on same one-box. Otherwise, you may face issues with source code controlling in Visual Studio.

- When a developer changes someoneâ€™s code, or relies on it, then in any case, he takes responsibility for the correct execution of the code.
