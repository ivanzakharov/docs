Naming conventions contribute to consistency and to making the application easier to understand.
## General Rules

  - All names must be in U.S. English.

  - The default rule is to use logical and descriptive names if no other specialized rules apply.

  - Identifier names have a limit of 81 characters.

  - Names in the Application Object Tree (AOT) and in X++ code must correspond to the names in the U.S. English user interface.

  - Names must be spelled correctly.

  - Names must be used consistently.

  - Each path in the AOT must be unique; nodes must not have identical names.

  - All texts that appear in the user interface must be defined by using a label. (This rule applies only if you want your solution certified as an international solution.)

  - Do not begin a name with "DEL\_" unless it is a table, extended data type or enum, and it is needed for data upgrade purposes. 

  - EDT cannot be with the same name as a Table, Base Enum, or Class.
  
  - Hereafter <b>_PRJ</b> suffix used for all customization in specific model (see [Model naming](model-naming)).
  
  - All customizations should have project suffix (see  referred as <b>_PRJ</b>).
  
  - Present naming conventions guarantee to have only one extension for the object.
