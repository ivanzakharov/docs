Methods, system functions, and variables have mixed-case names with a lowercase first letter. ![Warning icon](images/Aa658028.WarningIcon(en-us,AX.60).gif "Warning icon") The first letter of each internal word is capitalized. For example, classDeclaration, createProject.

Primitive types have lowercase names. For example, str, date, int, real, void, boolean. ![Warning icon](images/Aa658028.WarningIcon(en-us,AX.60).gif "Warning icon")

true, false, and null are all lowercase.

[Reserved words](x-keywords.md) in the X++ language all begin with a lowercase letter. For example, if, while, for, select, ttsCommit.


> [!TIP]
> <P>Use the function <STRONG>Add-Ins</STRONG> &gt; <STRONG>Source code title case update</STRONG> to "wash" your code to have correct case.</P>
> <P>If you use version control within Microsoft Dynamics AX and the <STRONG>RunTitleCaseUpdate</STRONG> option has been set to Yes, errors in the capitalization of the first letter of names are automatically corrected when you check the object in. The <STRONG>RunTitleCaseUpdate</STRONG> option is typically set by an administrator. It is available on the <STRONG>General</STRONG> tab of the <STRONG>Version Control Configuration</STRONG> form, which can be opened from <STRONG>Tools</STRONG> &gt; <STRONG>Development tools</STRONG> &gt; <STRONG>Version control</STRONG> &gt; <STRONG>Setup</STRONG> &gt; <STRONG>System settings</STRONG>.</P>
